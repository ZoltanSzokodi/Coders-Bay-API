# Codersbay-API
API built with Node.js, MongoDB and Mongoose for Object Data Modelling

# How to try it out
Since I there is no front-end (yet) the simplest way to test the endpoints is to fire up Postman and start sending requests.
Please check the documentation (created with the help of DocGen) for further instructions.
