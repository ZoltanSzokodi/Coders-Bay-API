# Codersbay API
Backend API built with Node.js, MongoDB and Mongoose for Object Data Modelling

## How to try it out
Since there is no front-end (yet) the simplest way to test the endpoints is to fire up Postman and start sending requests.
Please check the documentation (created with the help of DocGen) for further instructions.

## How to fire it up
Clone the repo, add your own credentials to the config/config.env file. Run npm install in the root to add dependencies

Dev mode
```
npm run dev
```
Prod mode
```
npm start
```
